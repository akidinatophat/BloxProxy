# BloxProxy
BloxProxy is yet another Roblox API Proxy for HttpService with 3 things in mind:
- Simple
- Reliable
- Configurable

With BloxProxy, say goodbye to dealing with Node.JS and NPM, and long live the hassle of Heroku deployments. All you need is to edit, add, and reload.
If you want to add another Roblox API to BloxProxy, just copy and paste the location directive, edit the url, and reload NGINX. It's that easy.
